Please make yourself familiar with our submission rules as explained in the initial [LIL announcement](https://peakd.com/hive-174695/@shaka/the-lmac-summer-special-lets-build-the-lmac-image-library).

For LIL contributions, it is very important to follow our formatting guidelines so that they are processed correctly by our automatic indexing system. Please read the "How it works" section carefully. Image submissions that are not formatted properly cannot be indexed and added to the LIL, nor can we upvote submissions that cannot be included in the LIL.

You can easily solve this problem by changing the markdown of your post accordingly. Just let us know via Discord or as a comment (please mention one of the moderators then).
