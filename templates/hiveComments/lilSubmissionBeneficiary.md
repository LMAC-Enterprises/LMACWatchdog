Please make yourself familiar with our submission rules as explained in the initial [LIL announcement](https://peakd.com/hive-174695/@shaka/the-lmac-summer-special-lets-build-the-lmac-image-library).

**Please note that we ask all participants to set the @lmac account as 20% beneficiary in their entry posts.** This allows us to provide attractive community prizes and secures you the support by our voting trail.

If you need further guidance on how to set beneficiaries, have a look at this great user tutorial [here](https://peakd.com/hive-174695/@eve66/basic-tools-to-create-your-first-collage-in-the-lets-make-a-collage-community-herramientas-basicas-para-crear-tu-primer-collage).
